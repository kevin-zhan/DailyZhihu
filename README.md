# daily_zhihu

A zhihu daily news app wrote in Flutter just for trying MVVM in Flutter.

## Build Tip
If you cannot find model.g.dart file and unable to build the project, try run the command `flutter packages pub run build_runner watch` in the root dir of the project.

## Thanks
The project is a try of mvvm in flutter. I don't have too much time to polish it.
To make the app run function completely, I use the repo [Kotlin-mpp](https://github.com/LanderlYoung/Kotlin-mpp)'s code to imp the 
content page.  

[Kotlin-mpp](https://github.com/LanderlYoung/Kotlin-mpp) is a nice repo which use kotlin-native & flutter to create a zhihu_daily app.  

Do recommend to star the repo, if you are interested in cross platform app development by kotlin-native or flutter.
